# Nand2Tetris Projects Repository

## Introduction
The Nand2Tetris course, formally known as *The Elements of Computing Systems*, is a comprehensive program that empowers learners to construct a complete modern computer system from the ground up. The course encompasses all layers of computer abstraction, including:

- **Hardware**: From basic Boolean gates to advanced ALUs and memory systems.
- **Software**: Understanding assemblers, virtual machines, and operating systems.
- **High-Level Languages**: Designing and implementing functional programming languages.

Through this course, I’ve gained invaluable insights into how computers work at a fundamental level.

## Projects
Here’s a brief overview of the projects I’ve completed:

1. **Project 1: Boolean Logic**  
   Implement basic logic gates using NAND gates to understand foundational logic.

2. **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**  
   Create circuits for performing arithmetic operations using logic gates.

3. **Project 3: Sequential Logic**  
   Design sequential circuits including flip-flops and registers.

4. **Project 4: Machine Language**  
   Develop a simple machine language and its corresponding instruction set.

5. **Project 5: Computer Architecture**  
   Assemble the various components into a functioning computer architecture.

6. **Project 6: Assembler**  
   Build an assembler that converts assembly language code into machine code.

7. **Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic**  
   Implement a stack-based virtual machine for arithmetic operations.

8. **Project 8: VM II: Program Control**  
   Extend the virtual machine to include program control features.

9. **Project 9: High-Level Language - Zombie Shooting Game**  
   Create a simple game to demonstrate high-level language capabilities.

10. **Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis**  
    Develop a compiler that performs syntax analysis on high-level code.

11. **Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation**  
    Extend the compiler to generate target code from the analyzed syntax.
